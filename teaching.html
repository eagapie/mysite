              I was an instructor for a 2-credit introductory programming course to HCDE Master’s students. The course fosters creativity and excitement about programming by engaging students in making interactive animations. Students, who often had a background or interest in design used p5js to build interactive stories and games. The course promoted a positive, supportive environment that would foster building confidence in programming skills.

              I led directed research groups where students engage in research projects. I organize research groups driven by student interests and their own learning objectives. Students have engaged in research projects through shaping research questions, designing study materials, collecting and analyzing data, programming or creating visual designs of tools. Several students leveraged the work they conducted with me to obtain other professional positions, from continuing research, to obtaining other full-time jobs in User Experience.

              I was a co-instructor for project-based seminars in which students engage in service learning. The undergraduate students collaborate with local middle and high school teachers and develop curriculum for design or programming workshops for their classrooms. Through this experience students learn basics of teaching, develop curriculum for classrooms that are often different than their own experience, and they get to practice explaining the value of their own discipline to others.

I designed the curriculum such that students worked together on developing a web platform through which they shared cultural insights from across the region the lived in.
